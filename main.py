"""
main.py — VoxEdge: Voice-controlled fan with speaker verification.

HOW IT WORKS (explain this in your viva):
──────────────────────────────────────────
1. On startup: load the Vosk speech-to-text model and the enrolled speaker
   embedding that was created by enroll.py.

2. Each cycle (triggered by pressing Enter):
   a. Record 3 seconds of audio via the microphone.
   b. SPEECH RECOGNITION: feed the audio to Vosk → get transcribed text.
   c. COMMAND PARSING: check whether the text contains "fan on" or "fan off".
   d. SPEAKER VERIFICATION: generate a Resemblyzer embedding from the same
      recording and compare it to the enrolled embedding using cosine similarity.
      • Cosine similarity = 1 → identical voices
      • Cosine similarity = 0 → completely different voices
      • We accept if similarity ≥ SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD
   e. Decide the outcome and update the GUI accordingly.

VOSK MODEL NOTE:
  Download vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15 from https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models
  Extract it and rename the folder to exactly: model
  Place the model/ folder in the same directory as this file.

Usage:
    python main.py
